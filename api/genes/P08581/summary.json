Receptor tyrosine kinase that transduces signals from the extracellular matrix into the cytoplasm by binding to hepatocyte growth factor/HGF ligand. Regulates many physiological processes including proliferation, scattering, morphogenesis and survival. Ligand binding at the cell surface induces autophosphorylation of MET on its intracellular domain that provides docking sites for downstream signaling molecules. Following activation by ligand, interacts with the PI3-kinase subunit PIK3R1, PLCG1, SRC, GRB2, STAT3 or the adapter GAB1. Recruitment of these downstream effectors by MET leads to the activation of several signaling cascades including the RAS-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, or PLCgamma-PKC. The RAS-ERK activation is associated with the morphogenetic effects while PI3K/AKT coordinates prosurvival effects. During embryonic development, MET signaling plays a role in gastrulation, development and migration of muscles and neuronal precursors, angiogenesis and kidney formation. In adults, participates in wound healing as well as organ regeneration and tissue remodeling. Promotes also differentiation and proliferation of hematopoietic cells. May regulate cortical bone osteogenesis., (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for Listeria monocytogenes internalin InlB, mediating entry of the pathogen into cells. Heterodimer made of an alpha chain (50 kDa) and a beta chain (145 kDa) which are disulfide linked. Binds PLXNB1. Interacts when phosphorylated with downstream effectors including STAT3, PIK3R1, SRC, PCLG1, GRB2 and GAB1. Interacts with SPSB1, SPSB2 and SPSB4 (By similarity). Interacts with INPP5D/SHIP1. When phosphorylated at Tyr-1356, interacts with INPPL1/SHIP2. Interacts with RANBP9 and RANBP10, as well as SPSB1, SPSB2, SPSB3 and SPSB4. SPSB1 binding occurs in the presence and in the absence of HGF, however HGF treatment has a positive effect on this interaction. Interacts with MUC20; prevents interaction with GRB2 and suppresses hepatocyte growth factor-induced cell proliferation. Interacts with GRB10. Interacts with PTPN1 and PTPN2. Interacts with LECT2; this interaction may have an antagonistic effect on receptor activation (PubMed:27334921). Interacts with HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1; the interaction suppresses MET kinase activity (PubMed:26517842).","full_name":"Hepatocyte growth factor receptor","image":"https://cdn.rcsb.org/images/rutgers/fy/1fyr/1fyr.pdb-250.jpg"}
