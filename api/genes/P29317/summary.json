Receptor tyrosine kinase which binds promiscuously membrane-bound ephrin-A family ligands residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. The signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is referred to as forward signaling while the signaling pathway downstream of the ephrin ligand is referred to as reverse signaling. Activated by the ligand ephrin-A1/EFNA1 regulates migration, integrin-mediated adhesion, proliferation and differentiation of cells. Regulates cell adhesion and differentiation through DSG1/desmoglein-1 and inhibition of the ERK1/ERK2 (MAPK3/MAPK1, respectively) signaling pathway. May also participate in UV radiation-induced apoptosis and have a ligand-independent stimulatory effect on chemotactic cell migration. During development, may function in distinctive aspects of pattern formation and subsequently in development of several fetal tissues. Involved for instance in angiogenesis, in early hindbrain development and epithelial proliferation and branching morphogenesis during mammary gland development. Engaged by the ligand ephrin-A5/EFNA5 may regulate lens fiber cells shape and interactions and be important for lens transparency development and maintenance. With ephrin-A2/EFNA2 may play a role in bone remodeling through regulation of osteoclastogenesis and osteoblastogenesis., (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes and facilitates its cell entry. Mediates HCV entry by promoting the formation of the CD81-CLDN1 receptor complexes that are essential for HCV entry and by enhancing membrane fusion of cells expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins. Homodimer. Interacts with SLA. Interacts (phosphorylated form) with VAV2, VAV3 and PI3-kinase p85 subunit (PIK3R1, PIK3R2 or PIK3R3); critical for the EFNA1-induced activation of RAC1 which stimulates cell migration (By similarity). Interacts with INPPL1; regulates activated EPHA2 endocytosis and degradation. Interacts (inactivated form) with PTK2/FAK1 and interacts (EFNA1 ligand-activated form) with PTPN11; regulates integrin-mediated adhesion. Interacts with ARHGEF16, DOCK4 and ELMO2; mediates ligand-independent activation of RAC1 which stimulates cell migration. Interacts with CLDN4; phosphorylates CLDN4 and may regulate tight junctions. Interacts with ACP1. Interacts (via SAM domain) with ANKS1A (via SAM domain). Interacts with CEMIP. Interacts with NCK1; may regulate EPHA2 activity in cell migration and adhesion.","full_name":"Ephrin type-A receptor 2","image":"https://cdn.rcsb.org/images/rutgers/mq/1mqb/1mqb.pdb-250.jpg"}
