Receptor tyrosine kinase which mediates the pleiotropic actions of insulin. Binding of insulin leads to phosphorylation of several intracellular substrates, including, insulin receptor substrates (IRS1, 2, 3, 4), SHC, GAB1, CBL and other signaling intermediates. Each of these phosphorylated proteins serve as docking proteins for other signaling proteins that contain Src-homology-2 domains (SH2 domain) that specifically recognize different phosphotyrosine residues, including the p85 regulatory subunit of PI3K and SHP2. Phosphorylation of IRSs proteins lead to the activation of two main signaling pathways: the PI3K-AKT/PKB pathway, which is responsible for most of the metabolic actions of insulin, and the Ras-MAPK pathway, which regulates expression of some genes and cooperates with the PI3K pathway to control cell growth and differentiation. Binding of the SH2 domains of PI3K to phosphotyrosines on IRS1 leads to the activation of PI3K and the generation of phosphatidylinositol-(3, 4, 5)-triphosphate (PIP3), a lipid second messenger, which activates several PIP3-dependent serine/threonine kinases, such as PDPK1 and subsequently AKT/PKB. The net effect of this pathway is to produce a translocation of the glucose transporter SLC2A4/GLUT4 from cytoplasmic vesicles to the cell membrane to facilitate glucose transport. Moreover, upon insulin stimulation, activated AKT/PKB is responsible for: anti-apoptotic effect of insulin by inducing phosphorylation of BAD; regulates the expression of gluconeogenic and lipogenic enzymes by controlling the activity of the winged helix or forkhead (FOX) class of transcription factors. Another pathway regulated by PI3K-AKT/PKB activation is mTORC1 signaling pathway which regulates cell growth and metabolism and integrates signals from insulin. AKT mediates insulin-stimulated protein synthesis by phosphorylating TSC2 thereby activating mTORC1 pathway. The Ras/RAF/MAP2K/MAPK pathway is mainly involved in mediating cell growth, survival and cellular differentiation of insulin. Phosphorylated IRS1 recruits GRB2/SOS complex, which triggers the activation of the Ras/RAF/MAP2K/MAPK pathway. In addition to binding insulin, the insulin receptor can bind insulin-like growth factors (IGFI and IGFII). Isoform Short has a higher affinity for IGFII binding. When present in a hybrid receptor with IGF1R, binds IGF1. PubMed:12138094 shows that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Long are activated with a high affinity by IGF1, with low affinity by IGF2 and not significantly activated by insulin, and that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Short are activated by IGF1, IGF2 and insulin. In contrast, PubMed:16831875 shows that hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Long and hybrid receptors composed of IGF1R and INSR isoform Short have similar binding characteristics, both bind IGF1 and have a low affinity for insulin. Tetramer of 2 alpha and 2 beta chains linked by disulfide bonds. The alpha chains carry the insulin-binding regions, while the beta chains carry the kinase domain. Forms a hybrid receptor with IGF1R, the hybrid is a tetramer consisting of 1 alpha chain and 1 beta chain of INSR and 1 alpha chain and 1 beta chain of IGF1R. Interacts with SORBS1 but dissociates from it following insulin stimulation. Binds SH2B2. Activated form of INSR interacts (via Tyr-999) with the PTB/PID domains of IRS1 and SHC1. The sequences surrounding the phosphorylated NPXY motif contribute differentially to either IRS1 or SHC1 recognition. Interacts (via tyrosines in the C-terminus) with IRS2 (via PTB domain and 591-786 AA); the 591-786 would be the primary anchor of IRS2 to INSR while the PTB domain would have a stabilizing action on the interaction with INSR. Interacts with the SH2 domains of the 85 kDa regulatory subunit of PI3K (PIK3R1) in vitro, when autophosphorylated on tyrosine residues. Interacts with SOCS7. Interacts (via the phosphorylated Tyr-999), with SOCS3. Interacts (via the phosphorylated Tyr-1185, Tyr-1189, Tyr-1190) with SOCS1. Interacts with CAV2 (tyrosine-phosphorylated form); the interaction is increased with 'Tyr-27'phosphorylation of CAV2 (By similarity). Interacts with ARRB2 (By similarity). Interacts with GRB10; this interaction blocks the association between IRS1/IRS2 and INSR, significantly reduces insulin-stimulated tyrosine phosphorylation of IRS1 and IRS2 and thus decreases insulin signaling. Interacts with GRB7. Interacts with PDPK1. Interacts (via Tyr-1190) with GRB14 (via BPS domain); this interaction protects the tyrosines in the activation loop from dephosphorylation, but promotes dephosphorylation of Tyr-999, this results in decreased interaction with, and phosphorylation of, IRS1. Interacts (via subunit alpha) with ENPP1 (via 485-599 AA); this interaction blocks autophosphorylation. Interacts with PTPRE; this interaction is dependent of Tyr-1185, Tyr-1189 and Tyr-1190 of the INSR. Interacts with STAT5B (via SH2 domain). Interacts with PTPRF. Interacts with ATIC; ATIC together with PRKAA2/AMPK2 and HACD3/PTPLAD1 is proposed to be part of a signaling netwok regulating INSR autophosphorylation and endocytosis (By similarity). Interacts with the cone snail venom insulin Con-Ins G1 (PubMed:27617429).","full_name":"Insulin receptor","image":"https://cdn.rcsb.org/images/rutgers/ga/1gag/1gag.pdb-250.jpg"}
