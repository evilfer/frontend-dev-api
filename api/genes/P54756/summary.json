Receptor tyrosine kinase which binds promiscuously GPI-anchored ephrin-A family ligands residing on adjacent cells, leading to contact-dependent bidirectional signaling into neighboring cells. The signaling pathway downstream of the receptor is referred to as forward signaling while the signaling pathway downstream of the ephrin ligand is referred to as reverse signaling. Among GPI-anchored ephrin-A ligands, EFNA5 most probably constitutes the cognate/functional ligand for EPHA5. Functions as an axon guidance molecule during development and may be involved in the development of the retinotectal, entorhino-hippocampal and hippocamposeptal pathways. Together with EFNA5 plays also a role in synaptic plasticity in adult brain through regulation of synaptogenesis. In addition to its function in the nervous system, the interaction of EPHA5 with EFNA5 mediates communication between pancreatic islet cells to regulate glucose-stimulated insulin secretion. Heterotetramer upon binding of the ligand. The heterotetramer is composed of an ephrin dimer and a receptor dimer. Oligomerization is probably required to induce biological responses (By similarity). Interacts (via SAM domain) with SAMD5 (via SAM domain).","full_name":"Ephrin type-A receptor 5","image":"https://cdn.rcsb.org/images/rutgers/r2/2r2p/2r2p.pdb-250.jpg"}
