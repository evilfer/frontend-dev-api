Tyrosine-protein kinase that acts as cell-surface receptor for fibroblast growth factors and plays an essential role in the regulation of cell proliferation, differentiation, migration and apoptosis, and in the regulation of embryonic development. Required for normal embryonic patterning, trophoblast function, limb bud development, lung morphogenesis, osteogenesis and skin development. Plays an essential role in the regulation of osteoblast differentiation, proliferation and apoptosis, and is required for normal skeleton development. Promotes cell proliferation in keratinocytes and immature osteoblasts, but promotes apoptosis in differentiated osteoblasts. Phosphorylates PLCG1, FRS2 and PAK4. Ligand binding leads to the activation of several signaling cascades. Activation of PLCG1 leads to the production of the cellular signaling molecules diacylglycerol and inositol 1,4,5-trisphosphate. Phosphorylation of FRS2 triggers recruitment of GRB2, GAB1, PIK3R1 and SOS1, and mediates activation of RAS, MAPK1/ERK2, MAPK3/ERK1 and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, as well as of the AKT1 signaling pathway. FGFR2 signaling is down-regulated by ubiquitination, internalization and degradation. Mutations that lead to constitutive kinase activation or impair normal FGFR2 maturation, internalization and degradation lead to aberrant signaling. Over-expressed FGFR2 promotes activation of STAT1. Monomer. Homodimer after ligand binding. Interacts predominantly with FGF1 and FGF2, but can also interact with FGF3, FGF4, FGF6, FGF7, FGF8, FGF9, FGF10, FGF17, FGF18 and FGF22 (in vitro). Ligand specificity is determined by tissue-specific expression of isoforms, and differences in the third Ig-like domain are crucial for ligand specificity. Isoform 1 has high affinity for FGF1 and FGF2, but low affinity for FGF7. Isoform 3 has high affinity for FGF1 and FGF7, and has much higher affinity for FGF7 than isoform 1 (in vitro). Affinity for fibroblast growth factors (FGFs) is increased by heparan sulfate glycosaminoglycans that function as coreceptors. Likewise, KLB increases the affinity for FGF19 and FGF21. Interacts with PLCG1, GRB2 and PAK4. Interacts with FLRT2.","full_name":"Fibroblast growth factor receptor 2","image":"https://cdn.rcsb.org/images/rutgers/dj/1djs/1djs.pdb-250.jpg"}
