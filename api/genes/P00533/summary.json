Receptor tyrosine kinase binding ligands of the EGF family and activating several signaling cascades to convert extracellular cues into appropriate cellular responses (PubMed:2790960, PubMed:10805725, PubMed:27153536). Known ligands include EGF, TGFA/TGF-alpha, AREG, epigen/EPGN, BTC/betacellulin, epiregulin/EREG and HBEGF/heparin-binding EGF (PubMed:2790960, PubMed:7679104, PubMed:8144591, PubMed:9419975, PubMed:15611079, PubMed:12297049, PubMed:27153536, PubMed:20837704). Ligand binding triggers receptor homo- and/or heterodimerization and autophosphorylation on key cytoplasmic residues. The phosphorylated receptor recruits adapter proteins like GRB2 which in turn activates complex downstream signaling cascades. Activates at least 4 major downstream signaling cascades including the RAS-RAF-MEK-ERK, PI3 kinase-AKT, PLCgamma-PKC and STATs modules (PubMed:27153536). May also activate the NF-kappa-B signaling cascade (PubMed:11116146). Also directly phosphorylates other proteins like RGS16, activating its GTPase activity and probably coupling the EGF receptor signaling to the G protein-coupled receptor signaling (PubMed:11602604). Also phosphorylates MUC1 and increases its interaction with SRC and CTNNB1/beta-catenin (PubMed:11483589). Plays a role in enhancing learning and memory performance., Isoform 2 may act as an antagonist of EGF action., (Microbial infection) Acts as a receptor for hepatitis C virus (HCV) in hepatocytes and facilitates its cell entry. Mediates HCV entry by promoting the formation of the CD81-CLDN1 receptor complexes that are essential for HCV entry and by enhancing membrane fusion of cells expressing HCV envelope glycoproteins. Binding of the ligand triggers homo- and/or heterodimerization of the receptor triggering its autophosphorylation. Heterodimer with ERBB2 (PubMed:10805725). Interacts with ERRFI1; inhibits dimerization of the kinase domain and autophosphorylation (PubMed:18046415). Part of a complex with ERBB2 and either PIK3C2A or PIK3C2B (PubMed:10805725). Interacts with GRB2; an adapter protein coupling the receptor to downstream signaling pathways. Interacts with GAB2; involved in signaling downstream of EGFR. Interacts with STAT3; mediates EGFR downstream signaling in cell proliferation. Interacts with RIPK1; involved in NF-kappa-B activation. Interacts (autophosphorylated) with CBL, CBLB and CBLC; involved in EGFR ubiquitination and regulation. Interacts with SOCS5; regulates EGFR degradation through ELOC- and ELOB-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. Interacts with PRMT5; methylates EGFR and enhances interaction with PTPN6. Interacts (phosphorylated) with PTPN6; inhibits EGFR-dependent activation of MAPK/ERK. Interacts with COPG1; essential for regulation of EGF-dependent nuclear transport of EGFR by retrograde trafficking from the Golgi to the ER. Interacts with TNK2; this interaction is dependent on EGF stimulation and kinase activity of EGFR. Interacts with PCNA; positively regulates PCNA (PubMed:17115032). Interacts with PELP1. Interacts with MUC1. Interacts with AP2M1. Interacts with FER. May interact with EPS8; mediates EPS8 phosphorylation. Interacts (via SH2 domains) with GRB2, NCK1 and NCK2 (PubMed:10026169). Interacts with ATX2. Interacts with GAREM1. Interacts (ubiquitinated) with ANKRD13A/B/D; the interaction is direct and may regulate EGFR internalization after EGF stimulation. Interacts with GPER1; the interaction occurs in an estrogen-dependent manner. Interacts (via C-terminal cytoplasmic kinase domain) with ZPR1 (via zinc fingers). Interacts with RNF115 and RNF126 (PubMed:23418353). Interacts with GPRC5A (via its transmembrane domain) (PubMed:25311788). Interacts with FAM83B; positively regulates EGFR inducing its autophosphorylation in absence of stimulation by EGF (PubMed:23912460). Interacts with LAPTM4B; positively correlates with EGFR activation (PubMed:28479384). Interacts with STX19 (PubMed:16420529). Interacts with CD44 (PubMed:23589287).","full_name":"Epidermal growth factor receptor","image":"https://cdn.rcsb.org/images/rutgers/dn/1dnq/1dnq.pdb-250.jpg"}
